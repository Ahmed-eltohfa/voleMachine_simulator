# 🖥️ Vole Machine Simulator

**VoleMachine_simulator** is a simple educational simulator for the **Vole Machine** — a conceptual computer architecture designed to help students understand the low-level execution of instructions such as `LOAD`, `ADD`, `STORE`, `JUMP`, and more.

This project simulates the **instruction cycle** (fetch → decode → execute), providing hands-on experience with basic assembly-like operations in a Terminal interface.
